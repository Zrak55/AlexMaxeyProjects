Game created with Unity

Originally, the game was created as a board game for the Game Projects course.  I thought it would play well as a video game as well.

The premise is based on the classic game Battleship, but enhaned with greater strategy and decision making.  This way, the game could be
made more interactive and engaging for a user, instead of just a random selecting of grid points.  Currently, the user plays against a 
rudimentary AI, but I plan to implement an AI that utilizes information given by the player just as the player receieves information from
the opponent, and eventually, introduce a simple machine learning algorithm to create a more formidable opponent.

The player has a certain number of actions they can take in a turn, including moving and shooting with pieces.  Shooting with a piece
gives away information about that piece's potential whereabouts to the opponent, giving the other player something to aim for and encouraging
players to constantly move and reposition their pieces.  If 3 peices are lined up, they shoot off a powerful area attack, giving away to your enemy
that there are a lot of pieces in this area, but allowing you to cover more ground.  These mixups to the classic game allow players to conceive
different strategies and make more decisions, creating a more healthy play experience overall.
