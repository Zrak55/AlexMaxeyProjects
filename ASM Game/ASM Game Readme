ASM Game Readme

The following files are associated with this project: ASM game code.rtf  Menu.txt  board.txt  minesweeper.txt

This collection of files was used for my final project in an Assembly language class.  Attached is the game code as well as the required text
files to run the game.

The project was to create something unique in assembly.  Andrew Kramer, the professor, suggested a game and gave basic functions to render screens and have 
basic movement.  Expanding upon this code, I created 3 different games: snake, minesweeper, and yahtzee.

While making these programs, I got a lot of practice with things like register management (with the limited number of registers) as well
as practicing concepts like flags in bit math, specifically for the yahtzee game.  The code has some improvements I would have made given
more time, such as making the minesweeper recursively check squares when a 0 bomb is found, however I am still vrey pleased with the end result
and the limits of assembly programming I pushed myself to in order to achieve the results I did.
