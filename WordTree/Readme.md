# Lexicon/Word Tree
Alexander Maxey

The attached code, when run, allows a user to manipulte a tree that can contain any 
word (in lowercase) the user inputs.  The tree can add or delete words, check the 
existence of a word or prefix, print every word, count the number of words, and load 
words from a file.

I find the concept of trees and recursion in computer science and programming to be 
very interesting, and thought it was a lot of fun to use a tree with more than just 
2 directions to go, unlike the normal binary trees that are commonly used in class.
