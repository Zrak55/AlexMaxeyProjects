# Perlenspiel Game

Written in Javascript and the Perlenspiel engine.  Launch web link to play.

This game is a resource-efficiency survival game.  Enemies attempt to move towards you and attack.  However,
they can only be seen if the player scans the map to find them.  THe player can select weapons to attack, each
costing different resource amounts and affecting different zones.  Killed enemies refund energy.  The name of 
the game is conserving energy by using the most efficient weapon and scanning as infrequently as possible.

This project was a lot of fun to create, as I needed to learn an unfamiliar language (Javascript) as well as
work with an unfamiliar, less mainstream game tool (Perlenspiel).  It broadened my horizons as both a programmer
and a Game Designer.
