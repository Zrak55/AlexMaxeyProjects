This project was created for the final project of GAME 222 at Dakota State University in collaboration with 3 other team memebers.  The game is a side-scrolling fighting game in which you must create the perfect dish without obtaining
the incorrect ingredients.  In this project, I was the primary programmer and team lead, while my team members helped with art, audio, and animations.  This project was a lot of fun to make, bringing it from the idea inception to
a fully realized game over the course of the semester.  Despite challenges posed by COVID-19 interrupting the semester, we are all still extremely proud of the game that was created.
