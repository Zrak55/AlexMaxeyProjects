Timewalk Tower Defense
Game was created as a part of Maxeymus Games, in conjunction with Nicholas and Emily Maxey.  Game was released
to Steam on January 1st, 2021
This game is an asymmetric tower defense, in which you build your defenses in traditional tower defense style,
then jump into the fray as a hero.  This project was very satisfying to work on, seeing my own ideas evolve into
a fully realized commercial product.  I learned much from working on this, including the importance of file
organization, proper OO principles in programming, and limiting scope creep.  I learned some useful skills as
well, such as working with pathfinding in Unity's Nav Mesh.  I am very satisfied with the result of the project
and can't wait to produce more works with the team.
